## Question 4:

1. &nbsp;
  1. if n=2 and r=1 then the condition n>r will succeed and break the loop, printing out "Better luck next time"
  2. if n=1 and r=1 then the condition n==r will succeed and continue the loop without printing "x"
  3. if n=2 and r=2 then the condition n==r will succeed and continue the loop without printing "x" but since thats the last iteration, it will print out "Wow you are lucky"
  4. if n=0 and r=2 then the condition n>r will fail and so "x" will be printed out and the next iteration of loop will start
2. In general, "Wow you are lucky" will be printed if r is less than or equal to n for all three iterations of the loop
