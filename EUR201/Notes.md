# high Rennaisance

## Bosch

### Garden of earthly delights

Trifold, comes together to form another Painting of a flood

Painting goes from light to dark. Possibly biblical / adam and eve

4 steps of alchemy
1. Conjuctions
2. fermentation
3. putrification
4. Cleansing

#### Style

High style images jumbled low style (Adam and eve with nude bodies)

Contains hybrid human/animals and animal/vegetable. Form of grotesque

Experimental topos characteristic of grotesque.

##### Strawberry man

combines vegetable and human together (no seperation in Strawberry and man). Connected at butt. Suggests food cycle of people shitting and that becomes fertilizer for more food.

##### Second image

Human animal penetrating each other. Mirror / Tree trunk with human

##### Third image

man and woman in a globe, man touching womans belly suggests fertilization. Surrounding globe suggests they themselves are in womb so suggests larger fertitlity cycles the humans are part of

**Bosch constantly suggest fertitlity cycles**

A lot of things in these images dont go together

Parade and bird like man together, but dont nescessarily go together. more grotesque.

Many oxymorons. "Experimental Topoi".

## Francisco Goya y Lucientes (1746 - 1828)

Progressive Politically. French Enlightment and revo. Grotesque dominated by Unconscious. more Experimental topos

### Giant - 1818

Neoclassical. Dreamlike, at night

### And so was his grandfather

Human Horse?

### The sleep of Reason produces monsters

More human bird.

Didn't stay Dada-ist very long. Dadaism means plastic. Take expectation and break it down.

He then became one of the earliest surrealists. Surrealism is "Pure psychic automation"

### The elephant of Celebes - 1921

Random association of unlike things will lead to a more productive image. Adds industrial to the animal human stuff.
