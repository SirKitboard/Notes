### Part 1

The pattern that is shown in the given example seems to be that the _s_ is not dropped when the plural object is at the end of the sentence. However, if the object is somewhere in the middle of the sentence then the _s_ is dropped. This might be because when it is dropped in the middle, the sentence still flows properly but dropping it at the end makes the sentence sound a but abrupt, as if something is still to follow.
No it doens't seem like it has anything to do with the meaning of the words or the sound.

### Part 2

In these cases, there is no numerical value before the plural words. Dropping an s is this case would cause ambiguity between whether its single or double. For example, saying "We had <u>pound</u> of fish that spoiled" could possibly mean "We had <u>pounds</u> of fish that spoiled" or "We had <u>a pound</u> of fish that spoiled". As a result the _s_ cannot be dropped without a numerical value before the object.
So the corrected rule is that the _s_ is dropped if it is in the middle of the sentence and not the end, with a numerical value before it.
